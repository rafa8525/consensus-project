# Patch: Fitness Agent Escalation Policy

## Problem
No defined agent response if all sync attempts (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Direct Connect) fail.

## Solution
Add to `fitness_tracking_system.txt`:

> If data remains unsynced for more than 6 hours:
> - Trigger summary alert to user's primary device
> - Log a privacy-safe timestamped sync failure
> - Broadcast fallback state to peer agents for continuity planning
