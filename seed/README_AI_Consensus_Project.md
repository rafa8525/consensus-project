# AI Consensus Project

## Overview

The **AI Consensus Project** is a fully autonomous, privacy-first AI system built for personal use. It consists of a multi-agent architecture that manages personal workflows such as:

- VPN activation
- Fitness and BMI tracking
- Financial monitoring
- Knowledge sharing
- Cross-device automation
- Simulation-based optimization

This project is designed to be cost-free, privacy-preserving, and continuously self-improving through memory retention, learning, and cross-agent collaboration.
