# Drill Simulation Plan – AI Consensus System

## Purpose
Test agent coordination and escalation logic across real-world failure types.

## Frequency
Every 14 days, randomized time block

## Components Tested
- VPN failover and auto-block logic
- Fitness data fallback and blackout alerting
- Communication escalation (SMS, push, local)
- GitHub sync resilience and local logging
- Agent reconciliation from partial logs

## Drill Steps
1. Randomly disable 1–2 subsystems
2. Trigger agent detection and escalate through the chain
3. Confirm alert and fallback logic operates as defined
4. Log drill success or exception and queue to GitHub
