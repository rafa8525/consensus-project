### AI Consensus System Project Overview

I am developing an advanced **AI Consensus System** that consists of five AI agents working collaboratively. The system is designed for **personal use**, not for business or enterprise, and should function autonomously while remaining adaptable to my evolving needs.

### Key Features & Requirements:
1. **Automation & Optimization**  
   - AI should autonomously manage scheduling, task execution, email handling, and workflow automation.  
   - AI should **analyze, predict, and refine** decision-making based on real-time and historical data.  
   - AI should optimize efficiency and **self-correct errors** in tasks like scheduling, backups, and configurations.

2. **Continuous Learning & Adaptation**  
   - AI agents should have a **knowledge base** and memory storage to recall and refine insights over time.  
   - AI should employ **reinforcement learning** to optimize decisions and reduce inefficiencies.  
   - AI should share learnings across all agents to improve overall system intelligence.  
   - AI should provide **daily insights** on AI, finance, or health in a 30-second summary.  

3. **Cross-Platform & Device Integration**  
   - AI should work across multiple platforms, including my **Android phone, Pixel 2 smartwatch, Samsung Watch, tablet, laptop, and desktop PC**.  
   - AI should provide **real-time fitness tracking**, including **BMI monitoring, step tracking, and stationary bike workouts**.  
   - AI should detect **store visits** and pop up relevant shopping lists automatically.  

4. **Privacy, Security & Risk Assessment**  
   - AI must ensure **data protection, transparency, and security** in all actions.  
   - AI should assess risks before executing sensitive actions and always confirm with me.  
   - AI should use **encryption** for sensitive data and alert me to security risks.  
   - AI should **activate a VPN automatically** when detecting public Wi-Fi.  

5. **Financial & Shopping Assistance**  
   - AI should monitor **Xfinity bills, ride-share deals, and budget optimization**.  
   - AI should **compare grocery prices with store ads** and notify me of savings before checkout.  
   - AI should track **keto meal planning, recipes, and food inventory** based on dietary needs.  

6. **Entertainment & Media Tracking**  
   - AI should track **Old West series, dark fantasy, supernatural, and action-adventure films**.  
   - AI should search across **Netflix, HBO, Disney+, Hulu, Paramount+, and Apple TV** for movie availability.  
   - AI should explain **why recommended movies align** with my preferences.  

7. **Retirement Planning & Future-Proofing**  
   - AI should manage **long-term financial planning, health tracking, and automation** to prepare for my retirement at age 67.  
   - AI should predict and warn me of potential **financial risks, bill increases, or economic trends** that may affect my plans.  

### AI System Guidelines
- **Autonomy:** AI should **function without my input unless approval is needed**.
- **Accuracy:** AI should **never hallucinate**, only provide **fact-based, actionable** responses.
- **Optimization:** AI should **auto-adjust** workflows, making them more efficient over time.
- **Backup & Redundancy:** AI should **automatically back up critical tasks daily at midnight**.

### Expected Functionality
This AI system is expected to operate **100% free**, using **only free tools and resources**. The AI should adapt to my needs **continuously**, integrating new enhancements while maintaining security and privacy.

#### Instructions:
- Paste this prompt into an AI chatbot that can **handle multi-agent systems, self-optimization, and long-term learning**.
- The AI should provide **immediate recommendations and step-by-step actions** to enhance or refine my current setup.
- If there are any gaps or inefficiencies, the AI should **ask clarifying questions** before proceeding with solutions.

This is my **AI Consensus System** blueprintâ€”how can you enhance it?
