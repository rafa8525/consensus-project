# Phase 2 Failover Enhancements – Perplexity Simulation Output

## 1. Stale Alert Recharge
- After 3 consecutive unacknowledged alerts, trigger a low-profile physical prompt (screen flash, vibration).
- Ensure all prompts are privacy-safe and contain no personal content.

## 2. Multi-Agent Consensus Check
- Before applying any restored data after sync outage, require approval from at least 2 peer agents.
- If quorum cannot be reached, delay restoration and log reason.

## 3. Expandable Policy Manifests
- Each agent now supports a dynamic `privacy_manifest.yaml`.
- Policy updates for device permissions or risk zones can be synced from consensus base.

## 4. Failover Drill Scheduling
- System will initiate cross-agent failover drills every 14 days.
- Each agent simulates a network, memory, or health data outage and logs success/failure.

## 5. Degraded Mode Protocol
- While in “degraded” system mode:
  - Suppress non-critical automation
  - Block remote API sync unless explicitly verified
  - Enforce read-only mode for memory writes until logs sync
