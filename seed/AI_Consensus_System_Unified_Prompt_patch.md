# Patch: Persistent Failure Broadcast Logic

## Problem
No fallback logic if both communication and logging fail.

## Solution
Add to `AI_Consensus_System_Unified_Prompt.txt`:

> If both comms and memory sync fail > 24h:
> - Each agent must broadcast a minimal, privacy-compliant system health summary to known peers
> - Summary must exclude sensitive data, but include flags like "no sync", "no SMS", or "no VPN"
> - Agents must retry public backups to GitHub when available
