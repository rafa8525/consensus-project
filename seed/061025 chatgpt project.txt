🔧 AI Consensus System - Unified Blueprint (v2025.06.10)
1. Overview
I am building a personal AI Consensus System powered by five collaborative AI agents. The system must be:

Fully autonomous and self-optimizing

Adaptable to evolving routines and priorities

100% free to operate (no paid APIs or tools)

Focused on privacy, learning, and proactive assistance

2. Core Capabilities
🧠 Automation & Optimization

Manage tasks, schedules, and workflows without input

Refine decisions using real-time + historical context

Auto-correct errors and optimize efficiency

📚 Learning & Memory

Shared, centralized knowledge base for all agents

Long-term memory across runs and devices

Reinforcement learning and daily insight summaries (AI, health, finance)

📱 Cross-Platform Integration

Real-time fitness + BMI tracking across Android, smartwatch, laptop

Trigger actions based on geolocation (e.g., show shopping list at Walmart)

Integrate with wearables and non-wearables

🔐 Privacy & Security

Auto-activate VPN on public Wi-Fi

Perform monthly security audits

Encrypt sensitive data and alert me to threats

💵 Financial Assistant

Track ride-share deals, Xfinity bills, grocery savings

Handle keto meal planning and inventory optimization

🎬 Entertainment & Media

Track interests like dark fantasy, Old West, supernatural shows

Cross-search Netflix, HBO, Disney+, Hulu, Apple TV

Justify why each media recommendation fits my taste

📈 Retirement & Risk Planning

Monitor long-term financial + health goals (target retirement age: 67)

Detect threats like inflation, billing spikes, or economic downturns

4. Instructions for Chatbot
Please treat this as an active agent architecture. I want your help to:

Enhance any weak areas in the system

Recommend concrete steps to upgrade or expand it

Point out missing pieces that could improve autonomy or resilience

Ask clarifying questions before taking action when needed

⚠️ Important Constraints:

Must stay cost-free

Must maintain privacy-first operations

Must work across devices and platforms

Must enable proactive, memory-aware notifications
