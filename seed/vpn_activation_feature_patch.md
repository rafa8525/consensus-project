# Patch: VPN Unprotected Period Logging

## Problem
No fallback log requirement if VPN fails to activate.

## Solution
Add to `vpn_activation_feature.txt`:

> If VPN fails to activate:
> - Log duration of unprotected state locally with timestamp
> - Trigger a "block all outbound" command if repeated failure within 4-hour window
> - Notify peer agents to verify their VPN state as redundant backup
