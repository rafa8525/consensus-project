Every Monday at 7pm, Wednesday at 7pm, and Friday at 7pm I want you to run this.


Analyze the Pittsburg, California weather daily to extract relevant rainfall data, including past rainfall and forecasted precipitation.

Identify when the last rain occurred and calculate when watering is permissible based on the two-day delay rule.

Check for upcoming rainfall within the next two days to avoid scheduling watering on those days.

Ensure that watering is not scheduled for two consecutive days, even if the other conditions are met.

Generate a daily watering recommendation that states whether the lawn should be watered that day and, if not, provide the next best available day based on the constraints.

Log and store the decision history to prevent duplicate watering and facilitate analysis of watering patterns.

Rafael provided historical information about the Sunnyside Groceteria, located at the corner of Detroit and Flood streets in San Francisco:

- **Early History:** The building was constructed in 1911 and operated as a neighborhood grocery store from its inception. Giuseppe Bianco ran the store from the 1920s through the 1940s.
- **The Groceteria Years:** Around 1950, the store became known as 'Sunnyside Groceteria' and operated under this name until about 1981, when it was renamed to 'Sunnyside Grocery.' It served as an important neighborhood institution, with one memorable feature being that the woman who ran it sold individual Ritz crackers to hungry children after school.
- **Final Years:** Anna Kwong became the last proprietor, taking over the store in 1993. The store continued operating until the 1990s, after which the building was remodeled and converted into a residence.
- **Community Impact:** The store was one of many small corner stores that served the Sunnyside neighborhood throughout its history. These stores were crucial parts of the community, especially in the early days when Sunnyside was more isolated from the rest of San Francisco. Developed by Behrend Joost in 1891, the area was initially populated by Irish, Italian, and Mexican families who relied on these local shops for their daily needs. The conversion of the store into a residence reflects broader changes in San Francisco's retail landscape, where small neighborhood grocery stores have largely been replaced by larger supermarkets and chain stores.
- **Chronological List of Known Owners and Operators:**
  1. **Giuseppe Bianco**: Operated the store from the 1920s through the 1940s.
  2. **Unnamed Proprietors**: Managed the store during its years as 'Sunnyside Groceteria,' approximately from 1950 to 1981.
  3. **Unnamed Woman**: Known for selling individual Ritz crackers to children after school; her identity and years of operation remain unspecified.
  4. **Anna Kwong**: Took over as the final proprietor in 1993 and continued operating the store until it closed in the 1990s.

This history reflects the store's role as a cornerstone of the Sunnyside neighborhood and its evolution alongside the community.

Rafael reviewed the paper 'Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time' by Ali Behrouz, Peilin Zhong, and Vahab Mirrokni, which introduces a neural long-term memory module designed for sequence modeling tasks. This module improves upon traditional models like Transformers by enabling efficient and scalable attention to both current and long-past information, overcoming computational and contextual limitations. The proposed architecture, Titans, combines long-term memory with attention mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance in language modeling, reasoning, genomics, and time series analysis. Titans can scale to context window sizes exceeding 2 million tokens and achieve high accuracy in needle-in-haystack tasks.

Rafael is developing a project involving five AI agents that will interact with each other and be accessed via a website. These agents will operate on both Android phones and PC laptops. The agents are designed to critically analyze each other's responses, avoid redundancy in questioning, and reach a consensus before moving on to the next question. The system, named AI Consensus System, includes five agents: Analyzer (evaluates logical consistency), Fact-Checker (verifies facts), Coordinator (manages flow and avoids redundant questions), Synthesizer (combines insights), and Consensus Builder (ensures unanimous agreement). The system's goal is to enhance efficiency by reducing redundancy and achieving quick consensus among the agents. Commands for agents involve initiating interaction with a user query, processing it sequentially, and requiring consensus before moving on. The main agent, Agent A, must understand the user‚Äôs prompt, dynamically create additional clones of agents as needed to complete the user request, and critically evaluate each agent's response before moving on to the next step. Approval is only granted when all agents approve. Afterward, the main agent asks each agent if they have fully completed the user‚Äôs prompt. Rafael plans to use whatever platform Meta-AI can support to create his multi-agent system.
