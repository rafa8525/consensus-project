* GPS Modes 
   * To edit which GPS mode you are using, hold the BACK/LAP button to open the Toolbox → System → More Settings → GPS → Mode 
      * Standard GPS: Standard GPS only takes one GPS reading per second and typically works well for normal use when under standard conditions. 
      * All Systems On Mode: All Systems On mode turns on all satellite systems simultaneously, including GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou, and QZSS. Previous generations of GPS watches only allowed for 2-3 systems to be turned on at once, we highly recommend that All Systems on is the GPS mode used for everyday workouts. 
      * Dual Frequency Mode: is the most powerful and accurate satellite mode available. This powerful mode enables the Pace 3 to communicate with satellite systems in two simultaneous frequencies, bringing next-level accuracy even when you are in challenging conditions or environments.
      * Ultra-Max GPS Mode: UltraMax GPS mode utilizes GPS, motion sensors and proprietary algorithms to extend the battery life without sacrificing too much of the tracking accuracy. For every 120 seconds, the GPS is switched on for 30 seconds. Ultra-Max mode will be the least accurate GPS tracking of all our GPS modes and is not recommended to be used unless necessary. 
* Battery Usage Report & Prediction
   * Built into every COROS watch is a "Battery Usage" tool that allows you to view on-demand usage reports on the consumption of your watch battery during the current charging cycle. 
   * To access the Battery Usage tool, hold the BACK/LAP button to access the Toolbox, then scroll until you find "Battery Usage"
   * The Battery Usage tool will then display a graph that shows you the current battery percentage of your watch, a graph showing your historical battery drain, when your last charge was, and the estimation of how long your battery will last based on "standard use". 
   * To view a more in-depth breakdown of the battery usage statistics, press the digital dial.
   * From this screen you can see the following metrics: Remaining Power, Estimated Daily Use Left, Estimated Max Daily Use Left, Estimated GPS Use Left, Last Charge, Since Last Charge. You will also find the most common features which cause battery drain here, and what percent of your recent battery drain can be attributed to these common features. Below is an explanation of each of the common features which consume battery:
      * System: Normal operating activities. Any type of regular maintenance on the watch or features that are vital to maintaining a functional watch (i.e. keeping the clock up-to-date) will fall within the "System" category
      * Notifications: Any notifications which are pushed to your watch, both for workout alerts (lap alerts, etc.) and daily notifications (calls, text messages, etc). This is displayed as a number rather than being included in the overall percentage estimate.
      * GPS Workouts: Any activity recorded which uses GPS signals to measure and record distance, etc.
      * Backlight: Any power used to illuminate your watch screen. The more you use your backlight (Night Mode, Backlight Gesture, etc.), the higher this percentage is likely to be.
      * Daily Heart Rate: Measurements taken that consume battery to provide daily heart rate data. You have the ability to specify this to "Real-Time" or "Every 10 Min"
* What sensors are in the watch? 
   * 3D Compass, Accelerometer, All-Satellite Dual-Frequency GNSS, Barometric Altimeter, Electrocardiogram Sensor, Gyroscope, Thermometer, Wrist-based Heart Rate Sensor, Wrist-based Pulse Oximeter
Wearing Your Watch
To ensure that your watch can gather the most accurate data possible, here are a few best practice tips to follow. 
* Wear the watch tightly, but not so tight as to cut off circulation. It should fit snug and not slide around with movement. 
* Leave a 1cm gap between your wrist bone and the watch. The higher the watch is above the wrist bone, the more flush the surface of your skin, and the less likely the sensor is to be impacted by flexion in the wrist. 
* Keep your hands warm. The OHR signal comes from your blood reflection. So, the more blood flow you have, the better signal your watch will receive. The weather doesn’t need to be freezing to impact your OHR accuracy. As long as your hands feel cold, your blood flow is reduced significantly. The best way to solve this is to try and keep the area where your watch is located on your wrist warm.. Another suggestion is always warm up your body (and your hands) before starting your workout in the winter. 
* Wait for your watch to display a stable HR reading. Just like your body, your OHR sensor requires some warm-up too. It’s recommended to stay on the “Start” page and wait a little longer so the watch can filter some noise by itself. Our watches also provide an alert beep to let you know when it’s ready to go ( if sounds are turned off, you will see a heart symbol that will be solid and steady when ready) 
* Select the proper training mode. The regular running, cycling, and swimming algorithms are not specifically built for tracking rapid changes in heart rate. When you train with intervals, please select the Interval Training mode under Run mode for enhanced heart rate tracking sensitivity.

Advanced Running Metrics
 power.jpg 

Running Power (provided directly from all COROS watches)
   * Power is the rate of effort used in running. Running uses more power than walking if the distance remains the same because the duration is shorter and speed increased. The power calculation is related to weight, speed, and other metrics. Running uphill with the same pace requires more power than running flat. Power data can help evaluate real-time workout intensity. Running power is a great tool to measure your training in addition to heart rate and other metrics.
Form Power
   * The amount of power wasted due to inefficiencies in your running form. The lower this number, the better and more efficient the runner. This is similar to the previous Running Efficiency metrics (now removed) in terms of running form insights.
   * Available only in the post-workout analysis when paired with COROS POD.
 groundtime-LRbalance.jpg 

Ground Time
   * Excellent: <210ms
   * Better: 210-240ms
   * Good: 240-270ms
   * Average: 270-300ms
   * Poor: >300ms
   * Ground time measures the amount of time each of your feet are in contact with the ground. Advanced runners tend to have shorter ground time. Elite runners’ ground time can be as low as 180ms.
Left/Right Balance
   * Orange: >L 51.5 Far more time on left foot
   * Yellow: L 50.6-L 51.5 Slightly longer time on left foot
   * Green: L 50.5—R 50.5 Good left/right foot balance
   * Yellow: R 50.6-R 51.5 Slightly longer time on right foot
   * Orange: >R 51.5 Far more time on right foot
   * L/R balance measures the percentage of ground time spent on each foot. Track running and trail running may cause the reading to drift away from the desired green zone. If the reading exceeds 55, your risk of injury may increase. 
 strideratio-height.jpg 

Stride Ratio
   * Excellent: <6%
   * Better: 6-8%
   * Good: 8-10%
   * Average: 10-12%
   * Poor: >12%
   * Stride ratio can help measure running efficiency. It is the ratio of stride height to stride length. When stride length is longer and stride height is lower, the amount of energy wasted going up and down is reduced and the running is considered more efficient. The stride ratio for advanced running form can be lower than 6%.
Stride Height
   * Excellent: <5cm or <2in
   * Better: 5-8cm or 2-3.2in
   * Good: 8-12cm or 3.2-4.7in
   * Average: 12-15cm or 4.7-5.9in
   * Poor: >15cm or > 6in
   * Stride height is the amount your body bounces vertically with each step. Lower stride height indicates that less energy is wasted bouncing up and down. Fatigue and incorrect running form may cause higher stride height.
 1.jpg 

Stride Length
   * Stride length measures the distance from heel to heel when you take two steps. It is an important factor to evaluate running form and techniques. On average, an adult’s stride length is 65 cm / 2.13 ft during walking and between 90-150 cm / 2.95-4.92 ft when running. Many runners overstride believing this will increase the speed. However, this will increase the risk of injury on muscles and knees. It is critical to find the stride length that suits you the best for training and races with the help of advanced running metrics from the COROS POD.

Base Fitness
Base Fitness measures the ability to take on exertion from long-term training. It is calculated based on your training load in the past 6 weeks which is essentially your fitness level with an exponentially weighted model. A higher value means your body is capable of training longer and more frequently at higher intensity. Base Fitness will gradually decline if you decrease volume and intensity of training compared to 6 weeks ago.

General Training Status
4-week Intensity Distribution 
   * Each training phase may focus on a different intensity. It is usually recommended to start off with low intensity early in the season and gradually increase the portion of medium to hard training. 4-Week Intensity Distribution breaks down your past 4 weeks’ training based on threshold zones to help you understand if it aligns with your plan. If your goal is to train hard but the 4-week intensity distribution shows that most of the training is easy, it is time to adjust your training focus and increase the intensity to spend more time in higher threshold pace zones.
   * There are 3 different intensity levels to categorize your road running. Threshold heart rate zones are used for all other workout types.
   * Easy: Threshold pace zone 1 or below
   * Medium: Threshold pace zone 2 and 3
   * Hard: Threshold pace zone 4 or above

7-Day Total Load & Recommendation 
   * 7-Day Total Load measures the total training load in the last 7 days. COROS evaluates if your recent training load is reasonable and recommends a zone that is least likely to get you injured while maximizing the training outcome based on your training history. If your 7-Day Total Load is higher than the recommended zone, you may consider reducing your training intensity to allow your body to recover more.

Intensity Trend
Load Impact divided by Base Fitness yields your Intensity Trend. This metric reflects the amount of fatigue your body is suffering from the recent training while considering your ability to sustain the impact. A low value means that your body is ready to take on more intensity while a high value indicates overtraining.
Many people may think load impact is your fatigue. Here's an example to explain the difference. While the load impact of a 100k training week may be similar for you and Eliud Kipchoge, the amount of fatigue left in your body can be entirely different because Eliud’s base fitness may be way above yours. To achieve the best race result or your best day in the mountains, you want the base fitness to be as high as possible, and fatigue to be low but not too low as this can lead to a decline in base fitness.
Intensity Trend is a powerful and objective tool to help provide accurate feedback to avoid injuries and adjust your training plan to reach the expected training outcome. To give the best recommendation, COROS has set 5 different fatigue zones for you. You will want to be in the Optimized zone (100-149%) for maximized training efficiency, and in the Performance zone (50-79%) for race days. The concept of tapering is to take your body from the optimized zone to the performance zone.
   * Excessive (≥150%): Recent training may be overreaching or excessive.
   * Optimized (100-149%): Productive training is increasing Base Fitness.
   * Maintaining (80-99%): Moderate recent Training Load; maintaining Base Fitness.
   * Resuming/Performance (50-79%): Resuming represents Increased Training Load is improving your fitness.  Performance represents you are ready to take on significant physical effort.
   * Decreasing (0-49%): Low recent Training Load; Base Fitness is declining.
Load Impact
Load Impact measures the amount of impact brought to your body from short-term training. It is calculated based on the training load in the last 7 days with an exponentially weighted model. A higher value means a higher impact is introduced to your body and will limit your performance from tiredness. Load Impact goes down if you take more rests and up if you train more.

Race Predictor
EvoLab provides race time and race pace estimates for 5k, 10k, half marathon, and full marathon based on your past 6 weeks’ training via your COROS watch and the COROS app. With this race predictor, you can plan your race strategy accordingly.
It is rare for someone to train for a 5k and a marathon at the same time, so different types of workouts will impact different race distance predictions. Long runs over 30k have a major impact on your marathon prediction while a 60-minute threshold pace run will mainly affect your 10k or half marathon estimates.

Recovery Timer & Suggestion
To get the best improvement to your fitness, you will have to train with fatigue, but training when you are too tired can easily lead to injury. After each training, the recovery timer provides feedback on the time needed to receive full recovery. The more you train with your COROS watch, the more accurate feedback it will give you as EvoLab keeps learning your fitness data.
Currently, the countdown is designed to be used during a training block with a maximum recovery time set to 96 hours or 4 days. Don’t be surprised if it tells you that you are ready to train hard again in a few days after a 100-mile race as most people will take an extended recovery following a goal race or completed training block. Please listen to your body, take enough rest, and start using the recovery timer again when you are ready to kick off a new training session.
   * 0% - 29%: Please rest
   * 30% - 89%: Ready for easy training
   * 90% - 100%: Ready for hard training

Road Running Metrics: Running Performance 
Running Performance is created to provide feedback on how good your last run is compared to your overall running fitness. The range goes from 80% to 120% and has five different levels from poor to excellent. Over 105% means you are outperforming yourself and likely to peak in races. Lower than 95% indicates that you may need more rest to bounce back
Running performance may not be available for the last road run if the workout is not over 10 minutes or if the intensity is too low.
The range is from 80% to 120% and has 5 different levels.
   * Poor: (80% – 95%)
   * Fair: (96% – 98%)
   * Good: (99% – 101%)
   * Great: (102% – 104%)
   * Excellent: (105% – 120%)
Road Running Metrics: VO2 Max
VO2 Max is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can consume during training. It is a very popular metric in a variety of training systems. A higher VO2 Max usually means better fitness. COROS estimates running VO2 Max based on workout data including heart rate and pace from your recent outdoor runs, which is tested to be very close to the lab test results. Also, VO2 Max is not a metric that should change drastically in a short term. The VO2 Max estimates from EvoLab are much more stable than those offered by other brands.

Threshold Heart Rate Zones
Lactate Threshold is the breaking point when aerobic training starts to transform to anaerobic training. It can also be defined as the intensity of training at which lactate acid begins to accumulate in the blood faster than it can be removed. It is a popular indicator used in competitive sports. In addition to the traditional heart rate zones, we’ve now introduced 6 threshold pace zones representing different focuses in training. Threshold pace zones are a great tool to measure your effort and it eliminates any issues that could develop with your heart rate readings.
EvoLab recommends personalized threshold heart rate and pace zones as the default setting based on your general fitness level. To better suit your training, you can edit the default zones or choose other heart rate zones such as max heart rate zones or heart rate reserve zones. Training at each zone has a unique effect on your body and fitness. You can improve base endurance, lactate threshold, anaerobic endurance by training at associated zones.
Below are the details of the default threshold heart rate and pace zones and they may not match the zones that are edited manually.
   * Zone 1 (Recovery)
   * This range corresponds to low exercise intensity. It is suitable for active recovery.
   * Zone 2 (Aerobic Endurance)
   * This zone is comfortable enough to maintain conversations. It is suitable for basic cardiopulmonary function training, which mainly exercises basic aerobic capacity. It is an effort that can be sustained for multiple hours, and easy or long runs usually fall into this category.
   * Zone 3 (Aerobic Power)
   * This range leads to a sudden increase in breathing rate and it becomes harder to maintain conversations. It is suitable for improving running form and techniques such as breathing or cadence. 
   * Zone 4 (Threshold)
   * This effort is barely sustainable and rather uncomfortable. Training in this zone improves your ability to sustain harder efforts for longer. It is an effort that can typically be sustained for 45-60 minutes, and 10-15 minute intervals usually fall into this category.
   * Zone 5 (Anaerobic Endurance)
   * This range has now exceeded your threshold ability and therefore becomes quite uncomfortable and unsustainable, making you uncomfortable and causing shortness of breath. It applies to high-intensity interval training, which mainly improves VO2 Max ability.  5 minute interval runs usually fall into this category.
   * Zone 6 (Anaerobic Power)
   * This zone's intensity makes you struggle to breathe. It is suitable for anaerobic training which improves anaerobic capacity and muscular endurance.  1-min interval runs usually fall into this category.

Training Effect
Training Effect is determined by training load per minute and evaluates how your training impacts both your aerobic system (from cardio building activities) and anaerobic system (from high-intensity interval training). What divides these two groupings is your Lactate Threshold. Generally, a lower load per minute below the lactate threshold intensity will help your aerobic fitness and a higher load above lactate threshold intensity will improve your anaerobic fitness. Both the aerobic and anaerobic training effects have the same scale from 0-5+ or inefficient to overreaching.
There are 6 different types of aerobic and anaerobic training effects:
   * Inefficient (0-0.9): Minimal effect on fitness
   * Recovering (1.0-1.9): Good for recovery but low on fitness improvement
   * Maintaining (2.0-2.9): Maintaining fitness
   * Improving (3.0-3.9): Improving fitness if repeated 2-4 times per week
   * Optimized (4.0-4.9): Improving fitness efficiently if repeated 1-2 times per week
   * Overreaching (5.0-5.9): Improving fitness significantly with sufficient recovery or may lead to overtraining

Training Focus
Training Focus measures the primary improvement based on the training load and intensity at the end of your run. The workout will be labeled with one of six different Training Focuses including Easy, Base, Tempo, Threshold, VO2 Max, and Anaerobic. While threshold zones are great for effort measurement, you typically won’t stay in one zone during your training session and this is why training focus is added to EvoLab. In a nutshell, Training Focus is determined by the differences in training load for each threshold pace zone.
   * Easy: This training helps with recovery.
   * Base: This training improves basic aerobic endurance.
   * Tempo: This training improves the ability to control rhythm in races.
   * Threshold: This training improves pacing at lactate threshold pace.
   * VO2 Max: This training improves VO2 Max.
   * Anaerobic: This training improves anaerobic endurance.

Training Load
Training Load measures the impact brought to your body from the training. Each workout tracked using a COROS device receives a training load score based on training impulse (TRIMP), a well-established method of quantifying training load using heart rate and workout time. 
Training Load can be added to data pages on your COROS watch to be viewed in real-time to gauge the intensity and duration of your training. Longer and more intense training yields a higher training load score. Compare your training load in your COROS watch or via the COROS app to see how today’s training compares to similar activities in the past.

Training Status
Training Status is calculated based on a rolling average of 7 and 42 days of training data, and tells you how effective your most recent training was. It consists of your Base Fitness, Load Impact, and Intensity Trend.
