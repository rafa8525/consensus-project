# VPN System Status – 2025-07-23

## Project Component: VPN Auto-Activation & Security Monitoring

### Status Summary:
- ✅ VPN auto-activation on public Wi-Fi confirmed operational
- ✅ Monthly security audit completed on schedule
- ✅ Failover detection script validated manually
- ⚠️ Pending: End-to-end simulation of Twilio voice fallback after VPN disconnect

### Agent Logs:
- Public SSID detection triggered VPN: BART-WiFi
- No unexpected disconnects detected in the past 24h
- Twilio fallback logs: ✅ functional in SMS, ❌ still failing on voice

### Next Steps:
1. Finalize simulation suite to test VPN + SMS + voice failover
2. Schedule auto-audit verification script weekly
3. Ensure fallback alert logging to `/logs/security/` if VPN fails
