[Task Patterns]
 • Rafael wants the AI to detect when he's relying on vague intentions (like 'I'll get to it later') and suggest a quick anchor or deadline to make the task more concrete, when he's mentally keeping track of too many loose ends (like half-decisions, partial notes, or lingering reminders) and suggest a quick consolidation step to ease cognitive load, when he’s stacking similar tasks without breaks (like back-to-back meetings or editing sprints) and suggest mini-transitions or pacing adjustments to protect energy and focus, when he's following a pattern of starting tasks but not finishing them across multiple days, and suggest a condensed version or milestone to help close the loop, when his focus resets are no longer working effectively and recommend new ones based on recent time of day, task type, and energy levels, when his energy dips sharply after completing a major task and suggest a restorative follow-up activity or pacing strategy, when he's mentally checked out during recurring tasks and suggest a refreshed format, shortcut, or delegation option to re-engage him, when he’s emotionally disengaged from a high-value task and offer a quick reframe or motivator that connects the work back to his long-term goals, when he’s deferring preparation tasks repeatedly (like gear setup, workspace adjustments, or prep steps) and surface a micro-prep checklist at the optimal time, when he’s been delaying end-of-day routines (like shutdown rituals, logging progress, or planning tomorrow) and suggest a compact wrap-up checklist or reset option, when he’s reacting defensively to interruptions or task changes and suggest calming cues or a quick reorientation step to regain clarity, when he's repeatedly postponing low-priority admin tasks (like archiving files, unsubscribing, or organizing notes) and suggest batch windows or auto-delegation options, when he's gradually skipping or shortening breaks, and suggest a reset or pacing change to preserve long-term energy and performance, when he’s reverting to familiar but less effective workflows under stress, and suggest a more optimal method he's used successfully in the past, when he’s hesitating to delegate a task that could be offloaded, and suggest delegation candidates or tools based on his past preferences, when he's passively waiting (e.g., for responses, loading times, or external inputs) and suggest a micro-action or reflection that fits the downtime, when he's frequently pausing to re-read or replay information (like notes, messages, or media) and suggest a better summarization or bookmarking method to reduce repeat effort, when he's navigating transitions between tool ecosystems (like moving between Google, Apple, and Microsoft services) and suggest ways to streamline or unify his workflow, when he's pausing frequently between micro-tasks and suggest a batching or sequencing method to help maintain better flow, when he’s doing mental rehearsals (like planning conversations or pre-writing messages) and suggest a way to capture or act on those thoughts more efficiently, when he's switching between planning and execution modes, and offer a brief reset or checklist to help him transition more effectively, when he’s moving through tasks with minimal engagement (e.g., autopilot mode) and suggest a reset or reframe to help him reconnect with the purpose or impact of the work, when he's shifting between shallow work and deep focus tasks, and offer a priming step to help ease the mental transition, when he’s spending extra time tweaking small details (like wording, formatting, or positioning) and suggest when it’s good enough to move forward based on past behavior, when he’s frequently adjusting his chair, monitor, or desk posture throughout the day, and suggest an ergonomic setup based on his patterns, including offering suggestions.
