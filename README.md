# consensus-project

An AI-powered framework for autonomous decision-making and workflow execution using multi-agent systems.

## 📌 Goals
- Build a scalable agent-based system for task planning, execution, and self-improvement.
- Enable ChatGPT and other AI models to read, plan, and coordinate tasks.
- Use version-controlled prompts, memory handling, and orchestration logic.

## 🧠 Agents (planned)
- `Planner`: Breaks down abstract goals into sequenced tasks.
- `Researcher`: Finds new data, sources, or strategies when needed.
- `Executor`: Runs defined workflows (or notifies humans).
- `MemoryManager`: Handles what's remembered, stored, and forgotten.

## 🗂️ Planned Structure
/agents/ - Individual agent definitions
/core/ - Task orchestration logic
/prompts/ - Versioned prompts for each agent
/memory/ - Simulated memory or logs
/scripts/ - Helper tools
/docs/ - System design and decisions

## 🔄 Status
Currently in initialization stage — folder structure and base agent design coming next.
