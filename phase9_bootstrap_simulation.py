## Agent Purpose:
Scans project memory for overlooked opportunities, contradictions, or knowledge gaps.
Provides weekly suggestions for system upgrades, deletions, or refinements.

## DSL Summary:
- Triggers weekly
- Reads: memory/, logs/, and agent behaviors
- Writes: memory/logs/agents/suggestions/
- Alerts only if new actionable insight is found

## Next Steps:
- Validate agent usefulness after 2 cycles
- Archive result to GitHub
